## 1. Quick Start

1. Clone the repository into a new folder for your new project.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:ismael01866/html-webpack-boilerplate.git new-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Run webpack

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The dev command will start webpack and webpack-dev-server and tell it to watch for changes in HTML, JS and SCSS files.

   If you want to compile all assets for production usage, run the following command.

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command tells webpack to run in production mode and compiles all of the assets in a minified version, ready to be delivered as production assets.
